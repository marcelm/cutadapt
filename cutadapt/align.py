	"""
	Compute a semiglobal alignment of strings s1 and s2.

	Return a tuple (r1, r2, start1, stop1, start2, stop2, errors)
	where r1 and r2 are sequences of the same length containing the alignment
	(an INDEL is marked by '-').

	start1 is the position within r1 at which the part of s1, that is aligned, starts.
	stop1 is the position within r1 at which the part of s1, that is aligned, ends.
	The same holds for start2, stop2.

	It is always the case that at least one of start1 and start2 is zero.

	It is always the case that either stop1==len(r1) or stop2==len(r2) or both
	(note that len(r1)==len(r2)). This is a property of semiglobal alignments.

	errors is the number of errors in the alignment.

	For example, pysemiglobalalign("SISSI", "MISSISSIPPI") returns:

	r1 = [ '-', '-', '-', 'S', 'I', 'S', 'S', 'I', '-', '-', '-']
	r2 = [ 'M', 'I', 'S', 'S', 'I', 'S', 'S', 'I', 'P', 'P', 'I']
	start1, stop1 = 0, 5
	start2, stop2 = 3, 8
	errors = 0

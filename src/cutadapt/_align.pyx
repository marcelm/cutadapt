cdef class Aligner:
    """
    Find a full or partial occurrence of a query string in a reference string
    allowing errors (mismatches, insertions, deletions).

    By default, unit costs are used, meaning that mismatches, insertions and
    deletions are counted as one error (edit distance).

    Semi-global alignments allow skipping a suffix and/or prefix of query or
    reference at no cost. Combining semi-global alignment with edit distance is
    a bit unusual because the trivial “optimal” solution at edit distance 0
    would be to skip all of the reference and all of the query, like this:

        REFERENCE-----
        ---------QUERY

    Conceptually, the algorithm used here instead tests all possible overlaps
    between the two sequences and chooses the overlap which maximizes the
    number of matches in the overlapping part, while the error rate must not
    go above a threshold.

    TODO working here

    To allow skipping of a prefix of string1 at no cost, set the
    START_IN_REFERENCE flag.
    To allow skipping of a prefix of string2 at no cost, set the
    START_IN_QUERY flag.
    If both are set, a prefix of string1 or of string1 is skipped,
    never both.
    Similarly, set STOP_IN_REFERENCE and STOP_IN_QUERY to
    allow skipping of suffixes of string1 or string2. Again, when both
    flags are set, never suffixes in both strings are skipped.
    If all flags are set, this results in standard semiglobal alignment.

    The skipped parts are described with two intervals (start1, stop1),
    (start2, stop2).

    For example, an optimal semiglobal alignment of SISSI and MISSISSIPPI looks like this:

    ---SISSI---
    MISSISSIPPI

    start1, stop1 = 0, 5
    start2, stop2 = 3, 8
    (with zero errors)

    The aligned parts are string1[start1:stop1] and string2[start2:stop2].

    The error rate is: errors / length where length is (stop1 - start1).

    An optimal alignment fulfills all of these criteria:

    - its error_rate is at most max_error_rate
    - Among those alignments with error_rate <= max_error_rate, the alignment contains
      a maximal number of matches (there is no alignment with more matches).
    - If there are multiple alignments with the same no. of matches, then one that
      has minimal no. of errors is chosen.
    - If there are still multiple candidates, choose the alignment that starts at the
      leftmost position within the read.

    The alignment itself is not returned, only the tuple
    (start1, stop1, start2, stop2, matches, errors), where the first four fields have the
    meaning as described, matches is the number of matches and errors is the number of
    errors in the alignment.

    It is always the case that at least one of start1 and start2 is zero.

    IUPAC wildcard characters can be allowed in the reference and the query
    by setting the appropriate flags.

    If neither flag is set, the full ASCII alphabet is used for comparison.
    If any of the flags is set, all non-IUPAC characters in the sequences
    compare as 'not equal'.

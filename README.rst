cutadapt-parallel
=================

This is a working implementation of a multi-threaded version of Cutadapt. It is based on a fork of Cutadapt 1.9.2_dev. Most of the changes here will be integrated into the main Cutadapt program, however some options/functionality may change in the process.

Performance Optimization: There is a main thread that reads from the input file(s) and posts batches of reads to a queue. There are one or more worker threads that take batches from the queue, process them, and post the results on a result queue. Finally, there is a worker thread

Cutadapt finds and removes adapter sequences, primers, poly-A tails and other
types of unwanted sequence from your high-throughput sequencing reads.

Cleaning your data in this way is often required: Reads from small-RNA
sequencing contain the 3’ sequencing adapter because the read is longer than
the molecule that is sequenced. Amplicon reads start with a primer sequence.
Poly-A tails are useful for pulling out RNA from your sample, but often you
don’t want them to be in your reads.

Cutadapt helps with these trimming tasks by finding the adapter or primer
sequences in an error-tolerant way. It can also modify and filter reads in
various ways. Adapter sequences can contain IUPAC wildcard characters. Also,
paired-end reads and even colorspace data is supported. If you want, you can
also just demultiplex your input data, without removing adapter sequences at all.

Cutadapt comes with an extensive suite of automated tests and is available under
the terms of the MIT license.
